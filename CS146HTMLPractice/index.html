                <h2>My Short Biography</h2>
                Hi! I'm Jack. I'm from Hunterdon County New Jersey. I'm 18 years
                    old and my birthday is March 15th. I like to play videogames and hang
                    out with my friends. I'm currently a computer science major here at 
                    Stevens, and so far I'm loving being so close to the city and Hoboken itself.

                    In terms of my family, I have both of my parents and my older brother. We're
                    pretty close as a family and even though I'm loving college, I'm definitely
                    missing them a little bit, along with my friends. But even though it's bittersweet
                    moving away from home, I'm only about an hour, so it's not really that bad.
                    Thanks for reading my little biography. :)
