            <p class = "purpose">Have you ever lugged your laundry down countless flights of stairs only to find out that there
                all of the laundry machines are full and there's a line of about 5 people sitting around in the laundry room?
                Maybe it's "peak laundry time" in your building, and you can't bother to bring your laundry up and down the stairs
                to your dorm every 10 minutes to bother checking. Or maybe, that guy from floor 3 is taking up 4 different machines
                for an amount clothes so small that could easily be washed in a sink. Regardless of whether or not you've experienced
                all, one, or none of these, that's where LaundryAid comes in.

            <h3 class = "question"> Q: What does LaundryAid do?</h3>
            <p class = "answer">A: Our website has maps for each laundry room for each dorm on the Stevens campus. When a user logs
                onto one of the maps, they can click to "reserve" the machine that they are using. The machine is then occupied on the website
                for the respective amount of time (user also enters certain information to gauge how long the load will be), and when that time is up
                the machine opens up again! This website is very reliant on the user being true to their word, so if you help us, we can help you!
            </p>
            <h3 class = "question">Q: How do I reserve my machine?</h3>
            <p class = "answer"> A: It's easy! Once you find your dorm room on the site, click the link leading to the machine map. Once here,
                select the machine you're using and answer the questions it asks you. Once done, toss your load in, set your timer, and get on with your day!
            </p>
            <h3 class ="question">Q: What if the website is wrong?</h3>
            <p class = "answer"> A: If the website is wrong, there's an option to report the error on the site (see the index to the left). Unfortunately,
                there is no real way to track whether or not a machine is usable (we run on a tight budget, so we can't afford fancy technology like that), 
                so LaundryAid is strictly run off of an honor-based system (for now)

            <li><h4>Bob Smith, Jonas Hall (4 stars)</h4>
                <p>After using LaundryAid, I don't need to worry about whether or not
                the laundry machines downstairs are open! My clothes are cleaner than ever!
                <br>(Note: LaundryAid does not make your clothes smell like lavender.) </p></li>
            <li><h4>Jim Clancy, Davis Hall (3.5 stars)</h4>
                <p>It's so easy to use! All I need to do is press a button and I'm done!
                    I can't believe it took so long for something like this to exist. Thanks, LaundryAid!
                </p></li>
            <li><h4> Jennifer Hudgens, River Terrace (5 stars)</h4>
                <p>This website is really cool! I like clicking the buttons. I still
                    don't really know how to do laundry, though. 
                </p></li>
